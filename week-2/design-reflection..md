What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The six phases are Info Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and delivery, and Maintenance

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The primary goal is to tell people something about me, nostly in a professional sense but also personal information to get a feel of who I am.  This will be
accomplished by including a bio, a list of projects I have worked on, and links to other links for me (linkedin etc)

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience is looking for people to work on projects and employ individuals in their company.  I plan to address this by including examples of my
work, a bio including what I have done in the past and my qualifications, and links to my profiles on LinkedIn and Github.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, 
contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
I want my users to look for information on and examples of my work.  From there I want them to be intrigued into contacting about potential 
business/employment opportunities.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
First, the planning is just as important as the executions.  If ideas and goals are not properly thought out in the early stages,
you can end up with a product that is clunky, doesn't meet user or client requirements, and will have to be redisigned later.  
User experience is a major factor in designing  a website.  You need to address who your user base is, what your user base is looking for,
and address the functionality of your design and its ability to run properly on multiple platforms.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is how a person reacts when they interact with a system, not just how they navigate a system, but the accessiblity,
utiltiy of the system, design and overall feel of the system.  UX is valuable because users are going to be the ones interacting with the system
and need to be satisfied while using it, by making clear to navigate, high utility, and easily accesible systems there will be a more satisfied userbase.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I thought the videos could have been tightened up and shortened a little, but I personally like brevity.
