What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a visual framework of how you want a site or page look.  It helps you plan for the code you need to create for a project.

What are the benefits of wireframing?
It allows one to visualize what you are creating and therefore, have better strategy when creating your code.  With a wireframe, you can better
include everything you will need in the code and visualize how to seperate out your code.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
It was fun playing with the tools, it helped me think of different ideas I might not have come up with on my own.  It helped to 
give me boundaries and goals to shoot for while creating my site.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I went back once or twice after thinking about the site more and looking at other sites for ideas.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
What do blogs generally look like? What links do I want display?  What info do users need who navigate to my blog.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I had fun exploring the different elements of wireframing.  After doing the first wireframe the second one was more tedious because
it seemed there was a little less room for creativity.
