// As a user I want to run a program called "sum" that will take an a set of numbers (whether set of numbers contains 
// an even or odd amount of numbers) and sums the numbers together.

// As a user I want a program called "mean", that will take the average of all of the numbers from a set of numbers.

// As a user I want a program called "median" that gives me the middle value of a set of numbers (or for a set of numbers with an even 
// amount of values, potentially the average of the 2 middle values, if the two middle values are not the same)
