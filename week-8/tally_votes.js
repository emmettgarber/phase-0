// For determining vote count

// For determining the officers

//  Use a for loop to pull each president value into an array
// Use the math.mode function to pull the highest vote getter for president
//  Then repeat the process for each

// __________________________________________
// Reflection

// What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
// Its pretty straight forward, just need to use a for loop and you can use multiple for loops to reach inside to the nested data

// Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
// By doing two layers of for loops we were able to make our refactor a very short concise bit of code.  

// What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
// For loops, some of the quirks using the Math function, reinforced why to use bracket or dot notation in calling values in objects.
