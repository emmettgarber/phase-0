      <h3>Blog Post: Version Control</h3>
      <section>
        <p>What are the benefits of version control?</p>
        <p>Week 1 has been a good stepping off point for getting into the DBC program, I’d like to highlight a few of the concepts that I have learned this week; version control, git and Github.  Version control allows you or a group to view changes that are made and track the different versions of a project.  This helps to prevent errors and to allow each other to see what each other person is working on.  Version control also allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interrupting each other’s work.</p>

        <p>How does git help you keep track of changes?</p>
        <p>Git allows one to see what changes they have made, using git status. From there one can decide what changes one wants to make with git add and git commit, and then push the changes you want to make to the repository.</p>

        <p>Why use GitHub to store your code?</p>
        <p>Github is a great tool to track the versions of code that you have saved.  It allows you to add titles and descriptions to each variation of your code, that can help to manage your project.  It also allows one to easily share their work with others to collaborate or check ones work.  It helps to allow for simultaneous work on the same code while providing version control at the same time.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, I’ve learned  a lot this week and hope I have been to explain some of what I learned.</p>

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I have used <p>, <section>, <div>, <ul>/<li> quite a bit.  These element have allowed me a lot of flexibility in creating elements that can be
manipulated as group or individually depending on my needs.

  How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Starts out with the parent(s), then branches to the children, and then their children etc.  The browser will then display these images 
based on different positioning, display, border, padding and margin setting that you give them.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
Snippets allow you to save templates of structure set ups for your site, these can be very useful if you will be creating multiple pages that all have
the same basic set up.  Unfortunately I am using Cloud9, which does not support snippets and as such I will probably not be using snippets despite
their clear usefulness.
