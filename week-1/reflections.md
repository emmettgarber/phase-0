1.1 Think About Time
For this research, I took a look at meditation, time boxing, Pomodoro technique, and effective ways to build habits.  
Currently I mostly just use deadlines to manage my time, which really is not the most effective way for me to manage my time.  
While I have always worked well in the crunch, I think to be more successful in DBC and overall I really need to build better 
habits around time management, so to build better habits I am going to start setting reminders of when to begin and end working on tasks.  
To do this I will use aspects of the Pomodoro technique, but I think that I will extend the times as I find when I get on a roll I am most 
productive, perhaps using 40 or 50 minutes of work before the short breaks.  During college I took some Tai Chi, which is closely related
to meditation, and I think I will begin to incorporate that into my work breaks, to help relieve some stress, calm my mind, and get my body moving.  
I want to begin incorporating the Time Boxing technique into my learning as well, which is setting a time limit for a task and then 
evaluating what progress was made and what tasks were able to be completed. I think this will help to manage my time more wisely
(seeing how much I can accomplish and better set time goals going forward) and will help develop my habits. 
Overall I plan on setting up a weekly calendar, paired with digital alarms, to set my study times, work times, and break times, and 
building in Time Boxing to help acclimate myself to how long new tasks and challenges will take. 

1.2 The Command Line
A shell is the command line or user-interface that one use to interact with and operating system. Bash is a shell that can be used with Unix.
The most difficult thing, was understanding the differences between cat, less, more. It required a little extra research and playing around 
with the commands to understand which each one did exactly and their uses.
I was able to use all of the commands. Took a second to realize what pushd and popd were doing but I got the hang of it.
In my opinion, the creation and deletion files were the most important commands to know. Even though they are simple, 
and lack some the utility and creativity of some of the other commands, they are the building blocks for which everything else functions, 
without being able to create files and directories many of the other commands are useless.

pwd – print working directory (shows what directory you are in)

ls – list directories and files that are in your current directory

mv – move file or directory to target location

cd- change the directory you are in

../ - refers to the parent directory of the one you are currently in

touch – create an empty file

mkdir- make a new directory

less- view a file in separate viewer

rmdir- remove a directory from your current directory

rm- remove a file from your current directory

1.4 Forking and Cloning

To create a new repository, first log into ones Github account, then look to the top right where there will be a “+” icon, 
select that and then select new repository.  Name the new repo and fill in the other appropriate information.

To fork a repo, first one needs to start with the location of the repo you want to fork on Github.  
Once there, at the top right there will be a fork icon.  Select this and then select where you want to fork the file to (if prompted). 
Forking can be useful when a project has already been started by someone else in the group or if you see some code or files that seem 
interesting you can fork the file and play around with them on your own, expanding and creating off of what others have done.

I found setting up git and Github to be fairly straight forward.  I like the simplicity and ease of use, seems like it will 
be a really valuable tool going forward.
