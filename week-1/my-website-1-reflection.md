Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Login to Github and select create repository in the top right, select all appropriate settings and names and a brief description if you wish. 
Select create repository once you have double checked your settings.  There will now be a URL on the top bar that is a link to your repository, 
copy this as we will need it shortly.  Go to you Sublime input or command line and got to the folder (or create a folder if you do not have one yet)
of the folder you want to clone to your repository.  Once you have accessed this folder, input git clone "URL that you copied", this will clone the 
repository to your machine.

Describe what open source means.
Open source is the practice of making files/codes/projects open to the use of others, allowing them to interact, change and experiment
with something that you have already created.  This allows people to better colaborate and share ideas in the hope of making something better
or greater.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I like Open Source, it allows for people to advance faster, to collaborate, share and create in ways that would not be possible otherwise.
There is probably no better way of sharing ideas or solving problems than getting as many minds on something as possible.  Of course there will be 
times when your ideas do not move in the way you thought they might or someone might point out flaws or better ways to do something but that 
is how we learn.  While there could be instances where this might prompt one to be nervous or protective in the long run I think Open Source
allows for greater growth and advancement, even if it sometimes does not lead to personal recognition for what one may have started.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses allow us to control to a certain extant how our work or code is being used, it helps to prevent ones work from being abused or 
stolen away from those who create it.  While we want to promote collaboration, we also need to be careful with how we share things.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This challenge helped to better cement the Git process and to help me understand exactly each function (particularly in the merging process) does.  
Practice makes perfect and the repitition helped me get a hang of it.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
No i just kept refering back to course guide.
