#Attr Methods

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]

# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# Pseudocode

# Input:
# Output:
# Steps:

class NameData

end


class Greetings

end



# Reflection
# What are these methods doing? They are calling on instance variables and printing them to the console, then the instance variables are being changed
# How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables?
# By running new methods that change the instance variables

# What changed between the last release and this release? Got rid of methods that were not needed
# What was replaced? Took at the methods defining age name and occupation as they were redundant and with the class system were not needed.  The attr reader for age was added
# Is this code simpler than the last? Yes it got rid of unneeded methods

# What changed between the last release and this release? Prints the same output
# What was replaced? Took out the change_age method and simply change the age when we call the method.  The attr writer was added
# Is this code simpler than the last? Yes it takes out some lines we dont need and cleans it up
